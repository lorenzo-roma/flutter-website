# flutter_website

Personal website made with Flutter Web. At the moment of writing it is still beta tecnology, and so there are some problems. Especially, the mouse wheel is laggy, I used a carousel (PageView) to overcome that problem in the desktop layout. From mobile it is still too slow even after some improvement on its performance.
